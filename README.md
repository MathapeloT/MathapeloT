### Hi <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">, I’m Mathapelo Thokoa
---
 I am an aspiring Front-End Developer at the beginning of my learning journey. I hope to be an ace at Javascript at the end of my course.

- When I am not busy learning and in total awe of the wonderful world of coding, I am also fine-tuning  my talent as a commercial model. I walk runways for local fashion designers as well as entering brand amassador competitions.

- I hope to use my coding skills in the education industry to create an environment that is not only easy to use but also accessible to the now-known as No-fee paying schools. This way, future generations from even the most bleek of backgrounds will have a chance at being part of the dynamic and ever-changing world of tech.
